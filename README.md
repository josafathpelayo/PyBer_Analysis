# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type: urban, suburban, or rural. In doing so,the knowledge of Pandas will be applied to create the DataFrames, and Maptplotlib will also be implemented to visualize the analysis. The main files used for this analysis is “ride_data.csv" and “city_data.csv”. Our results will display the ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city
type and a multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type.

## Results
Reference this chart for results [Result_Chart](https://github.com/josafathpelayo/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Challange_Chart.png)
- Total rides for city type:
	- Rural had 125 rides per city
	- Suburban had 625 per city
	- Urban had 625 per city

- Total drivers for city type:
      	- Rural had 78 drivers per city
	- Suburban had 490 drivers city
	- Urban had 24505 drivers city
	
- Total fares for city types:
 	- Rural had a total of  $4,327.93
	- Suburban had a total of $19,356
	- Urban had a total of $39,854.38
	

- Average fare per ride:
      - Rural had an average fare per ride of $34.62
      - Suburban had an average fare per ride of $30.97
      - Urban had an average fare per ride of $24.52
	
- Average fare per driver:
      - Rural had an average fare per driver of $55.49
      - Rural had an average fare per driver of $39.50
      - Rural had an average fare per driver of $16.57

## Summary
The results show that even though rural cities have the fewest total rides, drivers, and fares, they have the highest average fare per ride and driver. Interestingly, Urban cities have the highest total fare by city type over the span of January through March [Line Graph](https://github.com/josafathpelayo/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Pyber_summary.png). Due to this, there needs to be more recruitment of drivers in rural cities and suburban cities as the total rides to total drivers ratio is causing the drivers to get paid more than what they are charging per ride (when looking at average fare per ride and average dare per driver respectfully). Another way is to promote/advertise the service in these suburban and rural cities more to increase the total drivers so that more profits are made per ride and the drivers don’t cash in as much. Finally, the company can even use the statistics that was found in the results to recruit drivers that there is money to be made in these rural/suburban cities. In conclusion, urban cities will always have it’s total fares high as there’s bigger populations in these cities type, more attention needs to be focused on the other two types to increase the total fares and driver count/employees.
